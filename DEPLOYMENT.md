## Step 7: Update robots.txt (Optional)

## Your Live URLs

After deployment, your site will be available at:

## Updating Your Site

2. Go to GitHub repository
3. Click on the file you want to edit
4. Click the pencil icon (Edit)
5. Make your changes
6. Commit changes
7. Wait 1-2 minutes for changes to deploy

## Troubleshooting

### Site shows 404
- Wait 5-10 minutes after enabling Pages
- Check that repository is Public
- Verify Pages is enabled in Settings

### Site loads but booking doesn't work
- Check `config.js` has correct credentials
- Visit test.html to see specific errors
- Check browser console (F12) for error messages

### Changes not showing
- Wait 2-5 minutes for GitHub Pages to rebuild
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5)
- Check you committed the changes

## Maintenance

### Monthly Tasks
- Check that EmailJS is still under free limit (200 emails/month)
- Review bookings in Google Calendar
- Test booking flow

### When You Reach Email Limit
Either:
- Upgrade EmailJS to paid plan (~$5-10/month for 1000 emails)
- Reduce email notifications
- Use a different email service

## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Your API keys will be visible in the `config.js` file since this is a client-side application.

**To minimize risk:**
1. Restrict your Google API key to only Calendar API
2. Use API key restrictions in Google Cloud Console
3. Set HTTP referrer restrictions to your GitHub Pages domain
4. Never commit private/secret API keys

For sensitive business use, consider using a backend server.

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Share your booking site URL
2. ‚úÖ Add to Google Maps business listing
3. ‚úÖ Print QR code for shop window
4. ‚úÖ Share on social media
5. ‚úÖ Add to business cards
6. ‚úÖ Monitor bookings daily
